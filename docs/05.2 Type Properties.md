Type Properties
================================

The properties described in this section allow you to better describe the usage 
rules of the respective parameters to which they are associated.  

Where they exist, these properties should be described from the line 
immediately below the parameter definition and should start with a line that 
contains only '::'. The end of a property definition block will also be a line 
containing only '::'.  

**OBS:**  
_It is not recommended to use this property with `Union types` parameters._

Look at the descriptions of each property to know how to fill it out properly.

**Example 01**

``` shell
  # @param string $1
  # ::
  # - default : "use this value if this parameter is not set"
  # - min     : 10
  # - max     : 100
  # ::
  #
  # ...

  ...
```


&nbsp;
&nbsp;


## default

You CAN provide a default value for this parameter. Such value will be assumed 
by the same whenever it is not evoked by the user.

The presence or absence of this property indicates when a parameter is 
required. When it has a default value, then the absence of its declaration when 
evoking the function will be supplied by the default value.

It is good practice to always enclose values in single or double quotation 
marks.


&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## min

Your understanding of usage differs depending on the type of value being used.

For numeric values, sets the smallest value that the passed parameter should 
have, for text type values, indicates the smallest number of characters that 
sentence should have and for objects of type array defines the minimum number 
of elements it must have.

For values of the date and time type, the reference values only need to be 
compatible with the type itself. There is no explicit limit.

See the ``Reference Table`` in the section at the bottom of this page to 
understand how each type handles this property.


&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## max

Your understanding of usage differs depending on the type of value being used.

For numeric values, sets the largest value that the passed parameter should 
have, for text type values, indicates the highest number of 
characters that sentence must have and for objects of type array defines the 
maximum number of elements it must have.

See the ``Reference Table`` in the section at the bottom of this page to 
understand how each type handles this property.

## list : assocName type[c | o] case[ci | cs] min[>=0] max[>=min | 0]

Use this property to point to an associative array to be used as a picklist to 
be presented to the user during the step of populating the respective 
parameter.   

The keys of the associative array will be the values that the user is actually 
selecting, and the value associated with each key should indicate a list of 
labels that can be used as synonyms to facilitate user selection.  

Each label should be described separated by blank spaces. Use quotation marks 
to indicate a label that should behave like a single value, but remember that 
this practice can get in the way of typing because the user will also need to 
remember to surround the value with quotation marks.  

If the name of the associative array is prefixed with a sagging sign, only the 
keys will be taken into account for comparison purposes, and the values related 
to them should be ignored.  

The selection options will always appear to the user in alphabetical order 
(taking into account the keys themselves and not the legends).  

There are cases where the user can select more than one item from the list of 
valid options. In these cases the elements should be wrapped in quotation marks 
and defined in the same way as they would be if they were to be passed to a 
normal function.  


&nbsp;

### assocName

Name of the associative array that contains the valid options.


&nbsp;

### type

Default: `c`  

This argument indicates whether the list is **o**(open) or **c**(closed).
If **c** it will be closed, that is, it will accept as valid only the values 
defined in the associative array.  
If **o** then the picklist becomes just a fill orientation for the user and any 
value will be accepted.  


&nbsp;

### case

Default: `ci`  

Indicates the form of comparison that will be used to define whether the values 
entered are valid or not.  
**ci** indicates that the comparison is done by case insensitive.  
**cs** indicates that the comparison will be made by case sensitive.  


&nbsp;

### min

Default: `1`  

Indicates the minimum number of items that must be selected.  


&nbsp;

### max

Default: `1`  

Indicates the maximum number of items that must be selected.  
If you use the special value **0** it means that the threshold for selecting 
values is equal to the maximum number of items available in a closed list. If 
the list is opened then there are no limits to the definition of values.  


&nbsp;

**Examples**

``` shell
  declare -A ASSOC_CONTINENT=(
    ["africa"]="1 af"
    ["antarctica"]="2 an"
    ["asia"]="3 as"
    ["europe"]="4 eu"
    ["north america"]="5 na"
    ["oceania"]="6 oc"
    ["south america"]="7 sa"
  )



  # @param string $1
  # ::
  # - list: ASSOC_CONTINENT
  # ::

  ## Equivalent to
  ## list: ASSOC_CONTINENT c ci 1 1
  ## One and only one item from the list.
  ## Comparison will be made in an insensitive case (a == A). 



  # @param string $1
  # ::
  # - list: ASSOC_CONTINENT c cs
  # ::

  ## Equivalent to
  ## list: ASSOC_CONTINENT c cs 1 1
  ## One and only one item from the list.
  ## Comparison will be made in an insensitive case (a == a). 





  declare -A ASSOC_STATE=(
    ["es"]="1 'Espírito Santo'"
    ["mg"]="2 'Minas Gerais'"
    ["pr"]="3 'Paraná'"
    ["rj"]="4 'Rio de Janeiro'"
    ["rs"]="5 'Rio Grande do Sul'"
    ["sc"]="6 'Santa Catarina'"
    ["sp"]="7 'São Paulo'"
  )



  # @param string $1
  # ::
  # - list: ASSOC_STATE o ci 2 5
  # ::

  ## Select between 2 and 5 items from the list or include your own.
  ## Comparison will be made in an insensitive case (a == A). 

  ## Example of selecion
  myFunction "Paraná 'Santa Catarina' 'São Paulo' 2 'My Own State'"
```

## Reference Table

The table below shows how each type of variable behaves when used in 
conjunction with the 'min' and 'max' properties:
