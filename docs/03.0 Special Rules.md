Special Rules
================================

They are prefixes that can be used in any `strict type` and thus give them an 
adequacy for the expected value.

## Union types

Use only for function arguments.  
It is a notation of multiple types, separated by a `|` character.
In these cases we are defining that an argument can assume more than one type.

&nbsp;


## `?`
Any parameter defined with a type described below (except 'mixed') by 
definition will not accept empty values and are all considered mandatory.
If you want a parameter to accept empty value, use the ? {type} and thus, its 
validation will only occur if it is not empty.  

This symbol is not a type itself, it just gives the type that accompanies it 
the ability to have an empty value making that parameter optional.  
Used as a return type, it also indicates that an output can result in an empty 
string.  

If used in conjunction with any type defined in a `Union types`, it will make 
all other types optional.
