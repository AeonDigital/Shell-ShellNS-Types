Return Types
================================

In the list below are the types that are for exclusive use in returning 
functions and cannot be used as parameter types.

## `void`
Validate as parameter : ``false``  
Printable as return   : ``false``  

Use only for ``return`` declaration.  
Indicates that the function does not returns any printable results and that no 
status other than '0' is expected.

## `status`
Validate as parameter : ``false``  
Printable as return   : ``false``  

When used it means that the output status of the function is the result that 
must be evaluated to identify the result.  
Typically used in boolean check functions that do not emit a printable value.

&nbsp;


## `status+{type}`
Validate as parameter : ``false``  
Printable as return   : ``true``  

This type of return indicates that, in addition to the status code, there is a 
printable value that will be returned together.  
This is usually the output of a log or dialog function.

&nbsp;


## `setoutput`
Validate as parameter : ``false``  
Printable as return   : ``false``  

Use when the result of the function is stored in the temporary buffer of the 
'Output' lib. In this case, the results obtained can be accessed using the 
'shellNS_output_show' function.  
This is a 'pseudo-type' and can contain any response format.
