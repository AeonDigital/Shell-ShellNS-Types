Returns
================================

This section is used to indicate precisely what type of return is expected by 
the function.

By default, it should be the last described section of the function, after the 
parameter description section.

## Generic model

In this section we will look at a generic example of a return description 
block.  

``` shell
  #
  # ...
  #
  # @return [returnType]
  # [FreeText
  #   [Summary]
  #
  #   [Description]
  # ]
  #
  # ...
  #
```
