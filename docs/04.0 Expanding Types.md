Expanding Types
================================

The notations defined below can be used with any strict type both in defining a 
parameter and as a return type.  

The use of these notations is not possible in conjunction with `Union types` 
except `nullable`.

## `{type}[sep]`

The brackets positioned next to the name of a type indicate that is expected 
a list of values of that type, whose separator will be the string defined 
inside, and may even be a blank space.  

In this case, all values will be tested to conform to the selected type.

Using this way of expanding to a parameter that uses a validation list, if the 
only value entered is '*', it means that all available values should be 
considered as selected.

&nbsp;


## `{type} $n...[--endKey]`

Use only for `parameter` declaration.  

The set '...' indicates that this parameter definition remains the same for all 
parameters from this point until it finds the last value or the optional 'end 
key' (to be set always starting with --).  
This allows an unspecified number of values to be passed.  
The validation of all values will be subject to the same validation rules as 
the base type, so if it is allowing mixing types, use the `mixed` type.
